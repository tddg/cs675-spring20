## Project Milestone 1: Proposal Report

Recommended structure for the Proposal Report is:

* Title + abstract.
* Related work: Need to have >=15 references, about 1 page (single-spaced, 2-column
of the USENIX paper template). Reference could be papers, websites
 (e.g., GitHub repos, Internet articles, blog entries, etc.).
* Motivation + concrete problem statement (need not be formal, only concrete).
* Approaches/system_design/experiment_design proposed / planned to solve the aforementioned
problems: Initial thoughts + what you have done in design/setups/experimental_tests.
* Timeline/Expected milestones for achieving your goals.

> **IMPORTANT:** The deadline of proposal report is 11:59pm March 25.
2-3 (single-spaced, 2-column) pages for
main material + any number of pages for references. You should 
use the [USENIX latex template](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates).
To submit, do the following: Email your proposal report as an email attachment (pdf only) with Subject
line "CS 675 Proposal Report" to yuecheng at gmu dot edu .


## Project Milestone 2: Checkpoint Report

Your Project Checkpoint Report needs to have (1) some algorithms, (2)
some initial implementation, and (3) most importantly, **some initial
experimental data (mandatory!)** that you collect by running some 
preliminary experiments. While writing the checkpoint report,
you may want to think about, and address the following questions head-on
about your work:

* Question 0: What are your **techniques**?
* Question 1: What do your techniques **gain** you?
* Question 2: What do your techniques **lose** you? That is, what are the tradeoffs.
* Question 3: What do your **experiments** tell you? Show that your data supports your hypothesis, and show the gains, losses, and tradeoffs by using your techniques.

Please *ensure that your plots print ok on black and white printouts.
It is ok to use color, but you cannot solely rely on color to
distinguish datapoints or datalines*.

> **IMPORTANT:** The deadline of Project Checkpoint Report is 11:59pm April 15. You
should target a writeup of 4-6 pages (you may want to reuse some of the content from your
proposal report) for main material + any number of pages for
references. You should again use the [USENIX latex template](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates).
To submit, do the following: Email your report as an email
attachment (pdf only) with Subject line "CS 675 Project Checkpoint Report" to
yuecheng at gmu dot edu .


## Project Milestone 3: Final Report

The final deliverable of this course is **a conference-quality paper**.
Focus on the following Questions 0 through 5 (an extended version of
Question 0 through 3 in the Checkpoint Report requirement):

* Question 0: What is/are your **main hypothesis/hypotheses** in the project? This is a one-sentence summary of your paper. Position your paper w.r.t. other related work on the same or even similar problems (reuse relevant parts of your survey report here!). Show to the reader that your work is on a unique point in the design spectrum. Don't overstate it, don't understate it either. This statement is related to Question 5 below (yes, it's a chicken and egg problem!)
* Question 1: What are your **goals**?
* Question 2: What are your **techniques**?
* Question 3: What do your techniques **gain** you?
* Question 4: What do your techniques **lose** you? That is, what are the tradeoffs.
* Question 5: What do your **experiments** tell you? (This is related to Question 0, 3, 4 above, and again, it's an egg and chicken problem!) Show that your data supports your hypothesis, and show the gains, losses, and tradeoffs by using your techniques.

As well as pay attention to:

* Importance of problem,
* Novelty of solution,
* Evaluation of solution,
* Clarity of Presentation,
* Nits (grammar, references, etc.).

It is common that the implementation or experimental methodology gets
adapted during the course of your investigation. And therefore, given
that this is your final write-up, please make sure to
**refine/change/expand your texts in your Checkpoint Report to
clearly reflect your latest implementation & evaluation activities**.  A few
examples are listed as follows: 1. if you had promised to use AWS EC2
(in your proposal or checkpoint report), but in fact you are using a
local testbed; 2. if you had promised to hack into Kubernetes' UI,
but later on you found a better walkaround that works better. 

Please *ensure that your plots print ok on black and white printouts.
It is ok to use color, but you cannot solely rely on color to
distinguish datapoints or datalines*.

> **IMPORTANT:** The deadline of Final Project Report is 11:59pm May 15 (Friday). You should
target a writeup with 6-10 pages for main material + any
number of pages for references. References count as extra pages (not included in the 6-10 pages).
It is highly recommended to use the [USENIX latex
template](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates); however,
if you prefer to use MS Word, it is also OK.
To submit, do the following: Email your report as an email
attachment (pdf only) with Subject line "CS 675 Final Project Report" to
yuecheng at gmu dot edu. Please send your presentation slides with the email
as well. For the source code, you can tar them and send the instructor
an archived tar ball; or, if you prefer, you can create a **private** Mason GitLab repository
and share it with me. 
Please **DO NOT** post your final report on publicly
accessible repositories such as GitHub or BitBucket.
